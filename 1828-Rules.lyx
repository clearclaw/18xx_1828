The designer would like to thank Francis Tresham for the design and development
 of the wonderful field of 18xx games; Daniel Barnes, Brian Joughin, Bruce
 Murphy and Shelby Noonan their bounteous supply of inspiration, notions,
 complaints and sounding board in equal measures.
 In particular Daniel Barnes made key suggestions around the loan system,
 Brian Joughin helped with the rules language, Bruce Murphy proposed the
 initial concepts that became the cousins and Cost of Business chart and
 Shelby Noonan suggested what became the future trains.
 Additional thanks go to the many other play-testers too numerous to list.
 I have been honoured to design games for and with such wonderful people.
