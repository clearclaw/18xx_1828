The designer would like to thank Francis Tresham for the design and development
 of the wonderful field of 18xx games; Daniel Barnes, Roel van der Hoorn,
 Brian Joughin, Bruce Murphy and Shelby Noonan for their bounteous supply
 of inspiration, notions, complaints and sounding board in equal measures.
 In particular Daniel Barnes prompted key aspects of the train roster and
 got me to re-focus on aspects I had the most difficulty with as a player,
 Bruce Murphy made key suggestions around the the system formation rules,
 Roel prompted the key inspirations that drove player capitalisation amounts
 and the $250 private companies, Shelby Noonan helped with the tile roster
 and many map details & balances, and Brian Joughin helped with the rules.
 Additional thanks go to the many other play-testers too numerous to list.
 I have been honoured to design games for and with such wonderful people.
