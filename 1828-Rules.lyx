The designer would like to thank Francis Tresham for the design and development
 of the wonderful field of 18xx games; Daniel Barnes, Brian Joughin, Bruce
 Murphy, Shelby Noonan and Chris Shaffer their bounteous supply of inspiration,
 notions, complaints and sounding board in equal measures.
 In particular Daniel Barnes prompted aspects of the train roster, Bruce
 Murphy made key suggestions around the the system formation rules, and
 Brian Joughin and Shelby Noonan helped with the rules language.
 Additional thanks go to the many other play-testers too numerous to list.
 I have been honoured to design games for and with such wonderful people.
