The designer would like to thank Francis Tresham for the design and development
 of the wonderful field of 18xx games; Daniel Barnes, Brian Joughin, Bruce
 Murphy, Shelby Noonan and Chris Shaffer their bounteous supply of inspiration,
 notions, complaints and sounding board in equal measures.
 In particular Daniel Barnes prompted aspects of the train roster, Bruce
 Murphy made key suggestions around the the system formation rules, Brian
 Joughin and Chris Shaffer helped with the rules language and Shelby Noonan
 helped in working out many details of the track tile roster.
 Additional thanks go to the many other play-testers too numerous to list.
 I have been honoured to design games for and with such wonderful people.
