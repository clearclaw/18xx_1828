These files will be kept up to date on a vaguely best-effort basis.
If they don't agree with the track-tile PDFs in the directory above,
these files are out of date and the PDFs are correct.

Note that I run a customised version of tile designer, tweaked both
for its colours (below) and its typefaces (more extensive and
undetailed at this time).  As such, plopping these files straight
into an unadorned copy of tiledesigner will produce inaccurate
results.
